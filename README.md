  ## 3.	Mysmarttest (GitHub)
   ## Description: 
   * Web Application for a startup called **5d minds**. It enables students to login securely, train, take up tests, mock interviews and analyze their skills using the charts provided in the site to hone their technical skills.
   * Developed dynamic and interactive website that ensures high traffic, page views and user experience resulting in 60% increase in sales of the product among colleges, using **JS, Ajax, JSP, jQuery, CSS, HTML, BOOTSTRAP and Servlets, and JDBC, MYSQL and deploying it in AmzonWebServices (Elastic Beanstalk)**.
